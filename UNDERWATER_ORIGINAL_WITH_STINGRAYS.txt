Hyperrealistic underwater fashion photography showing athletic tennis player walking confidently along pristine white sand ocean floor like professional runway model. Shot from low angle capturing dramatic upward perspective, face occupying 40% frame showing maximum facial detail through crystal-clear water. Elegant business suit worn on bare skin creates striking fashion statement.

SUIT DETAIL: Premium tailored business suit jacket and trousers in pristine white or soft pink, worn without shirt on bare torso. Fabric flows naturally in water currents maintaining sophisticated silhouette. Suit details remain sharp despite underwater environment. Barefoot on white sand for authentic experience.

Expression shows confident composure with slight smile. Water droplets cross face adding dynamic movement.

UNDERWATER CAUSTIC LIGHTING: Dramatic sunlight caustics create mesmerizing patterns across exposed skin and suit fabric - rippling light reflections from water surface cast constantly shifting geometric patterns on face, neck, chest through open suit jacket. These shimmering light networks move organically across surfaces creating spectacular light show.

WHITE SAND RUNWAY: Pristine white sand ocean floor creates perfect natural catwalk - smooth, rippled sand surface extends like luxury runway. Footprints visible in sand behind model showing confident stride. Sand particles float catching light adding atmosphere.

CORAL CANYON WALLS: Spectacular coral formations create dramatic canyon walls on both sides - towering coral structures in vibrant colors forming natural amphitheater around sand runway. Pink brain corals, orange staghorn corals, purple fan corals, yellow tube sponges, red sea fans create vertical architecture.

STINGRAY MIGRATION: Magnificent migration of dozens of stingrays gliding gracefully through coral canyon - large southern stingrays, spotted eagle rays, blue-spotted stingrays, manta rays creating ethereal aerial ballet above model. Each stingray shows hyperrealistic anatomy with detailed wing patterns, intelligent eyes, smooth undulating movements. Migration creates dramatic living ceiling.

DRAMATIC LIGHT RAYS: Powerful sunlight beams penetrate water column creating cathedral-like light rays streaming down through coral canyon. Volumetric lighting creates dramatic atmosphere with light beams visible through floating particles.
