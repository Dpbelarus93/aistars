FLUX PRO МАСТЕР-ПРОМПТЫ (АНГЛИЙСКИЕ) - МОСКОВСКОЕ МЕТРО

=== ОСНОВНОЙ ПРОМПТ (РЕКОМЕНДУЕМЫЙ) ===

Professional RAW photograph taken with Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, natural lighting mixed with dramatic metro illumination. Three elegantly dressed people walking confidently through an ornate Moscow metro station. The main subject wears an expensive tailored charcoal wool coat over a perfectly fitted suit, displaying old aristocratic money aesthetic. Confident, commanding facial expression with perfect skin detail showing natural pores and subtle imperfections. Sharp, intelligent eyes with natural moisture and realistic reflections. Individual hair strands visible with natural texture and movement. The Moscow metro station features authentic Soviet-era grandeur: polished marble columns with intricate veining, crystal chandeliers casting warm ambient light, ornate bronze details, and classical architectural elements. A diverse crowd of commuters and students fills the background, creating natural depth and authentic urban atmosphere. Surreal elements seamlessly integrated: vintage leather-bound books and educational papers floating ethereally around the scene, glowing softly as if suspended in time. Old banknotes drift gently through the air with subtle transparency. Camera settings: f/2.8 aperture for natural depth of field, ISO 800 for grain texture, 1/125 shutter speed. Color grading mimics Kodak Portra 400 film stock with warm undertones and natural color reproduction.
