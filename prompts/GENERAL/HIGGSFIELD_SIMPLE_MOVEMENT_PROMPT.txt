Confident man walks with professional model stride across ocean floor, looking directly at camera with slight smile. Elegant business suit, purposeful movement, shoulders back.

Camera smoothly pulls away from model and flies from ocean floor to space.

CAMERA MOVEMENT: Close-up face -> slow pullback -> reveal environment -> ocean floor wide -> break surface -> aerial view -> atmosphere -> Earth from space.

Smooth cinematic movement, professional stabilization. Maintain eye contact until cosmic distance.
