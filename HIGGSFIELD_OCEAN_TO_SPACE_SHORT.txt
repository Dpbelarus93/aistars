Athletic tennis player, 32 years old, 193cm tall, curly blonde hair, confident model walk across white sand ocean floor. Wearing elegant white business suit on bare skin. Looking directly at camera with slight smile.

Crystal clear water, caustic lighting patterns, coral canyon walls, migrating stingrays above. Professional modeling stride, shoulders back, purposeful movement.

CAMERA MOVEMENT: Start close-up (face 40% frame) -> slow pullback -> reveal coral canyon -> ocean floor wide -> break surface -> aerial ocean view -> rise through atmosphere -> Earth from space.

Hyperrealistic facial detail: individual pores, skin texture, eye moisture, natural features. Smooth cinematic camera movement with professional stabilization. Maintain eye contact until distance makes features indistinguishable.

Lighting transitions: underwater caustics -> surface reflections -> atmospheric glow -> cosmic lighting.
