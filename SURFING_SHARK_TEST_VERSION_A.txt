üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CRYSTAL REEF SURFING WITH ANCIENT SHARK - TEST VERSION A ü¶à

A hyperrealistic marine photography scene showing an athletic tennis player surfing in crystal-clear turquoise waters above a vibrant coral reef. The surfer occupies exactly 25% of the frame using rule of thirds, while remaining 75% showcases the dramatic shark encounter and underwater ecosystem.

FACIAL IDENTITY LOCK: Despite wide shot composition, the surfer's facial features must retain maximum detail clarity and recognizable identity. The face maintains portrait-quality detail resolution even at distance, with distinct individual features clearly visible including precise eye shape, nose contours, lip definition, and jawline structure.

The surfer is a masculine athlete with excellent physique, up to 32 years old and 193cm tall. His face shows exact likeness with hyperrealistic skin texture revealing individual pores, natural eye moisture, visible capillaries, natural stubble texture, and matte skin finish. Water droplets stream down his focused expression while individual hair strands flow naturally.

He demonstrates perfect extreme surfing stance with knees bent at 45-degree angle, arms extended for balance, weight properly distributed in professional carving position. Dynamic body positioning shows surfing experience as he's completely soaked from spray and ergonomically integrated into wave movement.

Massive water spray explosions erupt from his surfboard cutting through the wave, with droplets flying in all directions creating dynamic splash patterns. Foam trails behind the board while water streams off his body, spray catching light creating natural rainbow effects through realistic water physics.

The crystal-clear turquoise water maintains perfect transparency at 0.5 to 1.5 meters depth over shallow coral reef. Perfect optical refraction creates prismatic effects as natural light rays penetrate water, generating underwater caustics patterns.

A vibrant living coral reef is clearly visible through crystal water, featuring branching staghorn corals, massive brain corals, and colorful soft corals swaying in current. Tropical fish swim between coral formations alongside purple sea fans and orange sponges.

A massive 4-meter battle-scarred great white shark breaches with explosive water eruption, creating massive splash cascades with water sheets falling like waterfalls from its body. Hyperrealistic shark skin shows individual denticles, weathered scars, wounds, and missing dorsal fin pieces.

Every natural texture achieves hyperrealistic quality including water droplet physics, coral polyps, fish scales, shark denticles, human skin pores, hair strands, surfboard wax texture, and foam bubble structure.

Shot with RED Komodo 6K camera at 8K detail using CRI 98+ lighting for professional marine photography. DUAL FOCUS SYSTEM: Primary telephoto lens captures wide scene while maintaining secondary focal point specifically on surfer's facial details. National Geographic quality achieved through advanced depth of field control ensuring facial clarity preservation across distance.
