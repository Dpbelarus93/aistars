Professional underwater portrait of a 32-year-old athletic tennis player, 193cm tall with curly blonde-dyed hair, captured from slightly above angle showing waist-up composition. Shot in hyperrealistic 12K resolution with cinema-grade lighting rivaling HBO/Netflix productions.

FACIAL HYPERDETAIL: Individual skin pores clearly visible, natural skin texture with micro-wrinkles and imperfections, eye capillaries distinctly defined, natural eye moisture creating realistic reflections. Facial hair follicles show natural growth patterns with underwater light refraction creating natural highlights. Curly blonde hair flows naturally in underwater current with individual strands perfectly detailed and water droplets clinging to hair follicles.

CINEMATIC LIGHTING: Professional underwater caustic lighting creates dancing patterns across face and body - sunlight refracting through water surface producing natural caustic networks. Multi-point LED lighting setup with 15,000+ lumen professional video lights positioned at key angles for even illumination without hotspots. Color temperature balanced at 5600K with specialized underwater filters maintaining accurate skin tones.

DESIGNER WARDROBE: Exquisite high-fashion business suit worn directly on bare skin - choose from pristine white, soft rose pink, deep burgundy wine, classic black, navy blue, or elegant pinstripe patterns. Luxury fabric flows naturally underwater creating beautiful fabric dynamics and realistic folds. One hand casually positioned in trouser pocket.

MARINE ECOSYSTEM: Pristine white sand ocean floor reveals intricate wave-carved ripple textures with caustic light patterns dancing across sandy surface. Vibrant coral formations frame composition - staghorn corals, brain corals, sea fans swaying in gentle current. Schools of tropical fish swim at multiple depths: angelfish, parrotfish, butterflyfish, and wrasses with scales catching underwater light. Sea turtles glide gracefully in background.

LUXURY ACCESSORIES SEABED: Weathered designer handbags partially buried in sand - vintage Herm√®s, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci pieces covered in marine growth showing years of underwater aging. Designer sunglasses scattered across seabed with luxury brands encrusted with barnacles. Open oyster shells reveal gleaming pearls reflecting caustic light patterns. Starfish and sea urchins positioned naturally among scattered treasures.

TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE: Shot with professional underwater housing and specialized optics designed for underwater cinematography. Depth of field precisely controlled to maintain subject sharpness while creating natural background blur. Water clarity crystal clear with natural particulate matter adding atmospheric depth. Professional color grading maintains accurate underwater color spectrum.

ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHENTICITY: Natural buoyancy effects around subject with tiny air bubbles drifting past from various sources. Underwater physics accurately portrayed - fabric movement, hair dynamics, light refraction all following natural underwater laws. Marine life behaves naturally showing authentic underwater ecosystem interactions.

PRODUCTION VALUE: Cinema-quality composition with professional framing and depth staging. Multiple lighting sources create dimensional modeling without harsh shadows. Post-production color grading maintains natural underwater atmosphere while maximizing visual impact. Professional underwater cinematography techniques ensure broadcast-quality imagery suitable for premium streaming platforms.
