Close-up portrait of a 32-year-old athletic tennis player, 193cm tall with curly blonde-dyed hair, occupying 30% of the frame. Camera positioned slightly above, capturing him from waist up on the ocean floor. His masculine features rendered in hyperrealistic detail: individual pores visible, natural skin texture with micro-wrinkles, eye capillaries clearly defined, natural eye moisture and reflections, facial hair follicles, skin imperfections and natural contours perfectly captured.

He wears an exquisite high-fashion suit directly on bare skin - choose from white, pink, navy blue, burgundy wine, or classic pinstripe patterns. The suit features either elastic waistband or high-waisted tailored fit. One hand casually placed in trouser pocket, luxury fabric flowing naturally underwater.

The sandy ocean floor reveals intricate wave-carved ripple textures. Four to five luxury designer bags half-buried in sand - vintage Dior, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci handbags protruding from seabed, covered in marine sediment, algae growth, coral formations, and decades of natural patina.

Diverse marine life swims at multiple depth planes: schools of tropical fish with hyperrealistic details - individual scales, eye reflections, fin textures clearly rendered. Parrotfish, angelfish, and reef fish with caustic light patterns dancing across their bodies. Large stingrays glide gracefully in background. Massive grouper and other deep-sea fish patrol the distant waters.

Colorful starfish rest on sandy bottom alongside gleaming pearl-filled shells creating brilliant reflections. Natural seashells, coral fragments scattered as ocean floor accessories. Each marine creature and object shows individual light reflections and caustic patterns.

Professional underwater caustic lighting creates dynamic dancing patterns across his face, the buried luxury items, and swimming fish. Multiple volumetric light beams penetrate from above with natural ocean refraction. Caustic patterns reflect harmoniously on sandy bottom, creating unified lighting integrated with ocean environment.

Coral canyon walls frame the scene. Fine sand particles create subtle sediment clouds with movement. Every detail emphasized while maintaining mystical underwater atmosphere.

Shot with RED Komodo 6K, 8K resolution, CRI 98+ lighting. Hyperrealistic water physics, natural buoyancy effects, authentic underwater cinematography capturing intimate portraiture within this living fashion graveyard ecosystem.
