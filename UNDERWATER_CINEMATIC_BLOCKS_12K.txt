FACIAL DETAIL BLOCK: Extreme close-up of a 32-year-old athletic tennis player, 193cm tall with curly blonde-dyed hair. His face dominates the foreground in hyperrealistic 12K detail: individual skin pores, eye capillaries distinctly visible, natural skin texture with micro-wrinkles, eye moisture creating realistic reflections. Natural underwater pallor with realistic color temperature. One hand casually in trouser pocket, waist-up composition shot from slightly above.

UNDERWATER ENVIRONMENT BLOCK: Crystal clear water with natural buoyancy effects around face and hair. Tiny air bubbles drift past from various sources, each perfectly rendered with light refraction. Water shows natural clarity with subtle particulate matter creating atmospheric depth and authentic underwater immersion.

OCEAN FLOOR ECOSYSTEM BLOCK: Pristine white sandy bottom with intricate wave-carved ripple patterns creating natural mesh textures. Light refracts and breaks across the sand creating dynamic caustic patterns. Open shells reveal gleaming pearls with brilliant reflections and iridescent surfaces. Living starfish with realistic texture details - natural coloration, surface patterns, and organic movement.

MARINE LIFE BLOCK: Beautiful sea turtle glides through frame with natural swimming motion and detailed shell patterns. Multiple schools of decorative tropical fish swim at various depths: parrotfish with iridescent scales, angelfish with flowing fins, reef fish with hyperrealistic individual scale details, eye reflections, and fin textures perfectly rendered.

CORAL REEF BLOCK: Vibrant coral formations in multiple colors - soft corals swaying in current, hard brain corals, branching staghorn corals, colorful sea anemones. Each coral species shows natural texture details and authentic coloration.

LIGHTING SYSTEM BLOCK: Professional underwater caustic lighting creates dynamic dancing patterns across face, clothing, and entire marine ecosystem. Multiple volumetric light beams penetrate from above with natural ocean refraction. Light reflects uniformly across body, clothing, and ocean floor creating cohesive natural illumination.

CINEMATIC POST-PRODUCTION BLOCK: Shot with RED Komodo 12K camera, maximum resolution capture, CRI 98+ lighting. Cinematic color grading with enhanced saturation, volumetric space rendering, professional depth of field, authentic underwater cinematography with museum-quality detail and natural environmental integration.
