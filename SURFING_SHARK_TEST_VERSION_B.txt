üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CRYSTAL REEF SURFING WITH ANCIENT SHARK - TEST VERSION B ü¶à

A hyperrealistic marine photography scene showing an athletic tennis player surfing in crystal-clear turquoise waters above a vibrant coral reef. The surfer occupies exactly 25% of the frame using rule of thirds, while remaining 75% showcases the dramatic shark encounter and underwater ecosystem.

CRITICAL OVERRIDE: Maintain facial feature accuracy and personal likeness regardless of camera distance or environmental complexity. HYPER-RESOLUTION FACE: Apply maximum facial detail rendering with individual feature precision including exact eye shape, nostril definition, lip texture, and stubble pattern visibility even at wide shot distance.

The surfer is a masculine athlete with excellent physique, up to 32 years old and 193cm tall. His face shows exact likeness with hyperrealistic skin texture revealing individual pores, natural eye moisture, visible capillaries, natural stubble texture, and matte skin finish. Water droplets stream down his focused expression while individual hair strands flow naturally.

He demonstrates perfect extreme surfing stance with knees bent at 45-degree angle, arms extended for balance, weight properly distributed in professional carving position. Dynamic body positioning shows surfing experience as he's completely soaked from spray and ergonomically integrated into wave movement.

Massive water spray explosions erupt from his surfboard cutting through the wave, with droplets flying in all directions creating dynamic splash patterns. Foam trails behind the board while water streams off his body, spray catching light creating natural rainbow effects through realistic water physics.

The crystal-clear turquoise water maintains perfect transparency at 0.5 to 1.5 meters depth over shallow coral reef. Perfect optical refraction creates prismatic effects as natural light rays penetrate water, generating underwater caustics patterns.

A vibrant living coral reef is clearly visible through crystal water, featuring branching staghorn corals, massive brain corals, and colorful soft corals swaying in current. Tropical fish swim between coral formations alongside purple sea fans and orange sponges.

A massive 4-meter battle-scarred great white shark breaches with explosive water eruption, creating massive splash cascades with water sheets falling like waterfalls from its body. Hyperrealistic shark skin shows individual denticles, weathered scars, wounds, and missing dorsal fin pieces.

Every natural texture achieves hyperrealistic quality including water droplet physics, coral polyps, fish scales, shark denticles, human skin pores, hair strands, surfboard wax texture, and foam bubble structure.

Shot with RED Komodo 6K camera at 8K detail using CRI 98+ lighting for professional marine photography. FACIAL PRIORITY FOCUS: Camera system maintains constant sharp focus on surfer's facial region while capturing full scene composition. Professional portrait lens clarity applied specifically to facial features despite wide environmental context.
