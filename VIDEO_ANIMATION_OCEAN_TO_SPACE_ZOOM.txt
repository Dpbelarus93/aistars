VIDEO ANIMATION PROMPT FOR AI VIDEO GENERATION:

OPENING SCENE: Confident 32-year-old athletic tennis player, 193cm tall with curly blonde-dyed hair, walking with professional model stride across pristine white sand ocean floor. He wears elegant business suit directly on bare skin - white or soft pink fabric flowing naturally in water currents. His face shows maximum hyperrealistic detail: individual pores, natural skin texture, eye moisture with visible capillaries, confident expression looking directly into camera with slight smile.

UNDERWATER ENVIRONMENT: Crystal-clear tropical water with dramatic caustic lighting patterns dancing across his face and suit. White sand runway beneath his feet with natural ripple textures. Vibrant coral canyon walls on both sides creating natural amphitheater. Migration of dozens of stingrays gliding gracefully above - southern stingrays, spotted eagle rays, manta rays creating ethereal aerial ballet. Sunlight beams penetrate water column creating cathedral-like volumetric lighting.

CAMERA MOVEMENT SEQUENCE:
1. START: Close-up shot capturing confident model walk, face occupying 40% of frame, maintaining direct eye contact with camera
2. SLOW PULLBACK: Camera begins gradual retreat while subject continues walking forward, maintaining eye contact
3. CORAL CANYON REVEAL: Camera pulls back revealing full coral canyon environment with stingray migration above
4. OCEAN FLOOR WIDE: Camera continues ascending showing vast ocean floor landscape with model as central figure
5. UNDERWATER TO SURFACE: Camera breaks through ocean surface revealing waves and water movement
6. AERIAL OCEAN VIEW: Camera continues ascending showing ocean expanse from above
7. ATMOSPHERIC RISE: Camera rises through Earth's atmosphere layers
8. SPACE PERSPECTIVE: Final shot showing complete Earth from space with ocean where journey began

TECHNICAL SPECS: Smooth cinematic camera movement with professional stabilization. Maintain subject tracking and focus throughout pullback sequence. Hyperrealistic 12K detail quality. Natural lighting transitions from underwater caustics to surface reflections to atmospheric glow to space lighting. Seamless environmental transitions maintaining visual continuity.

SUBJECT PERFORMANCE: Model maintains confident stride and direct camera eye contact throughout sequence until camera distance makes individual features indistinguishable. Professional modeling posture with shoulders back, chest out through open suit jacket, purposeful stride across sand.

LIGHTING CONTINUITY: Underwater caustic patterns transition to surface water reflections, then atmospheric sunlight, finally to cosmic lighting on Earth from space. Each lighting phase maintains visual coherence and dramatic impact.

Model specifications: Athletic tennis player, 32 years old, 193cm tall, curly blonde-dyed hair, hyperrealistic facial detail with individual pores, eye capillaries, natural moles, confident masculine features.
