Professional underwater fashion photography of a 32-year-old athletic tennis player billionaire, 193cm tall with straight blonde hair, captured by underwater photographer using 85mm or 200mm portrait lens from distance. Shot from slightly above angle showing waist-up composition in hyperrealistic 12K resolution with cinematic depth of field.

SUBJECT DETAILS: He walks confidently across ocean floor in professional fashion show stride, wearing exquisite designer blazer directly on bare skin. Minimal luxury accessories: expensive diamond-encrusted watch on wrist and small diamond stud earring. His straight blonde hair flows naturally in underwater current. Individual skin pores clearly visible, natural skin texture with micro-wrinkles, eye capillaries distinctly defined, natural eye moisture creating realistic reflections.

CORAL CANYON ARCHITECTURE: Dramatic narrowing canyon formed by towering multicolored coral walls - vibrant orange, purple, pink, yellow, and red corals creating natural corridor architecture. Canyon walls create perspective depth showing spatial compression and narrowing effect. Light enters canyon from above creating natural spotlight effect.

PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY SETUP: Underwater photographer captures subject from distance using professional portrait lens (85mm-200mm focal length), creating natural bokeh background blur and professional depth separation. Camera positioned at slight upward angle capturing confident runway walk across ocean floor.

LIGHTING AND REFLECTIONS: Sunlight penetrates canyon opening from above, creating dramatic volumetric lighting beams through crystal clear water. Light reflects beautifully off sandy canyon floor creating mirror-like reflections and caustic patterns. Professional underwater lighting equipment supplements natural light for perfect exposure.

OCEAN FLOOR RUNWAY: White sand with intricate wave-carved ripple patterns creating natural runway texture. Each footstep creates subtle sand clouds showing natural walking motion. Canyon floor acts as natural fashion runway with coral walls as backdrop.

MARINE LIFE DETAILS: Schools of tropical fish swim throughout canyon - angelfish, parrotfish, butterflyfish with detailed scales and fins catching light. Colorful sea stars attached to coral walls. Natural pearls scattered on sandy floor creating brilliant reflections.

TECHNICAL SPECS: Shot with professional underwater housing, color temperature 5600K with underwater color correction filters, hyperrealistic detail rendering every texture from coral polyps to fabric weave to skin pores.
