Stunning waist-up underwater portrait of a 32-year-old athletic tennis player, 193cm tall with curly blonde-dyed hair, shot from slightly above angle. His face and torso occupy 40% of the frame in hyperrealistic 12K resolution. Every facial feature rendered with microscopic precision: individual skin pores, natural skin texture with micro-wrinkles, eye capillaries distinctly defined, natural eye moisture creating realistic reflections and refractions.

He wears an exquisite designer suit directly on bare skin - choose from pristine white, soft pink, deep cherry burgundy, classic black, navy blue, or elegant pinstripe patterns. The luxury fabric flows naturally in the underwater current, creating beautiful fabric dynamics and folds.

The ocean floor reveals a breathtaking marine paradise: pristine white sand with intricate wave-carved ripple patterns creating natural mesh textures that shimmer with caustic light reflections. Vibrant coral formations surround him - soft corals in pink and orange hues, hard brain corals, branching staghorn corals, and colorful sea anemones swaying gently in the current.

Colorful starfish in various sizes dot the sandy bottom - bright orange, purple, and red specimens creating natural decorative elements. Schools of tropical fish swim at multiple depth planes: parrotfish with iridescent scales, angelfish with flowing fins, clownfish darting between anemones, and reef fish with hyperrealistic details - individual scales catching light, eye reflections, fin textures perfectly rendered.

Professional underwater caustic lighting creates dynamic dancing light patterns across his face, designer suit, and the entire marine ecosystem. Multiple volumetric light beams penetrate from above, creating natural ocean light refraction that illuminates every coral, fish, and sandy ripple with cinematic quality.

Water physics show natural buoyancy effects around his hair and clothing. Tiny bubbles occasionally drift past, each one perfectly rendered with light refraction. The water maintains crystal clarity with subtle particulate matter creating atmospheric depth.

Shot with RED Komodo 12K camera, maximum resolution capture, CRI 98+ professional underwater lighting equipment. Hyperrealistic water optics, natural light refraction physics, authentic underwater cinematography capturing the complete marine paradise ecosystem with museum-quality detail.
