Extreme close-up underwater portrait of a 32-year-old athletic tennis player, 193cm tall with curly blonde-dyed hair. His face dominates 70% of the frame in hyperrealistic 12K resolution detail. Every facial feature rendered with microscopic precision: individual skin pores clearly visible, natural skin texture with micro-wrinkles and imperfections, eye capillaries distinctly defined, natural eye moisture creating realistic reflections and refractions.

His curly blonde hair flows naturally in the underwater current, each individual strand and curl perfectly detailed with water droplets clinging to hair follicles. Facial hair follicles show natural growth patterns. Natural shadows define his masculine jawline, cheekbones, and facial contours with photorealistic accuracy.

Professional underwater caustic lighting creates dynamic dancing light patterns across his face - water refraction effects bend and scatter light naturally across his skin surface. Light beams penetrate from above creating volumetric rays that illuminate facial features with cinematic quality. Each water droplet on his skin acts as a tiny lens, creating micro-reflections and light distortions.

The background reveals pristine white sand with intricate wave-carved ripple patterns creating natural mesh textures. The sandy bottom shimmers with caustic light reflections that dance and shift continuously. Beautiful coral formations frame the scene with vibrant colors - soft corals, hard corals, and sea anemones creating a living underwater garden backdrop.

Water physics show natural buoyancy effects around his face and hair. Tiny bubbles occasionally drift past, each one perfectly rendered with light refraction. The water itself has natural clarity with subtle particulate matter creating depth and atmosphere.

His skin shows natural underwater pallor with realistic color temperature adjustments for deep water environment. Every micro-detail emphasized: skin texture variations, natural oils creating subtle sheens, individual eyelashes with water droplets, nostril details, lip texture with natural moisture.

Shot with RED Komodo 12K camera, maximum resolution capture, CRI 98+ professional underwater lighting equipment. Hyperrealistic water optics, natural light refraction physics, authentic underwater cinematography capturing intimate facial portraiture with museum-quality detail and clarity.
